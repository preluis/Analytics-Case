# Analytics-Case
 
Considering the information on tables in the "data" folder, it's needed to get all the account's monthly balances between Jan/2020 and Dec/2020.
The SQL engine used was SQLite and SQLite studio as DMS.
For Python resolution it was used JupyterLab with Anaconda Navigator.
  
## System Requirements

- Python (version 3.10.9)
- SQLite3 library (version 2.6.0)
- Pandas library (version 1.5.3)

## Environment Setup

This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

- SQLite: A relational database for storing and querying data.
- SQLite Studio: A graphical client for managing and visualizing SQLite databases.
- Jupyter Lab (Anaconda Navigator): An interactive development environment used for running Python code and SQL queries.

Make sure you have these tools installed on your system before running the code.

## Setup Instructions

1. SQLite Installation: (https://sqlite.org/download.html)
2. SQLite Studio Installation: (https://sqlitestudio.pl/) 
3. Jupyter Lab (Anaconda Navigator) Installation: (https://www.anaconda.com/download).

## Project Structure

- /data: Folder containing the database files and the database (only for drive version).
- /diagram: Folder with a slice of the table structure from the Data Warehouse Environment (diagram/table_diagram.png) and the code used to generate these diagrams on file (diagram/table_diagram.txt).
- /instructions: Deeper information about the analytics case.
- /result: Folder with final CSV file with monthly balance.
- /scripts: Folder containing SQL and Python scripts.
- README.md: Current file containing information about the project.

## Usage

### For SQL resolution:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub: https://github.com/preluis/Analytics-Case.git or download the drive folder
2. Open SQLite Studio and load the existing database "db", from drive or GitHub folder.
3. Execute from SQLite the provided SQL script in the database to create the tables and load the data.

### For Python resolution:
1. Open Jupyter Lab and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the Python file (script.ipynb) and follow the script guidane, make sure to adjust the db path in the code.
3. Run the Python file to perform data queries and analysis.


## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the database connection in the Python code is properly configured to reflect your environment and database location.
- If you encounter any issues during setup or execution of the project, feel free to contact me for further assistance.
